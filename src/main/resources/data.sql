        'Hoppetosse is the on-water sister venue to the well-known Club der Visionäre. It''s a permanently docked boat (dubbed MS Hoppetosse), located on the Spree not far from Arena Club. There''s usually one dance floor—surrounded by crystal-clear Morf speakers from Mo Stern—in action at parties, which usually take place on the weekends. Like its smaller neighbour, Hoppetosse''s booking policy focusses on minimalist house and techno, delivered by a combination of local favourites and a rotating cast of the style''s key names..',
